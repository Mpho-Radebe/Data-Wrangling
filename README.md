# Data-Wrangling: 

This is my second project in the Data Analytics Nanodegree I am enrolled for at Udacity. In this project, using Python, I wrangle, analyze and visualize a dataset which is the twitter archive of a twitter account @dog_rates, an account that is known for rating dogs. I will tackle some data quality and tidiness issues in the gathered datasets.
# Project Goal:
* Data gathering
* Assessing data
* Data cleaning
* Storing data
* Analyze and visualize data
* Report
